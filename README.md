## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This project didn't take me a long time because it doesn't contain many elements, but required me to think about the responsiveness. I chose to use grid because of the offsetted cards.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) even if it's of no interest in this particular project
